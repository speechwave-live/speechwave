# Roadmap

Deferred work identified while working on other projects. Items here are
acknowledged but intentionally not in scope for the work that surfaced them.
Move an item out (with a link to its spec/plan) once it's actively planned.

## Auth & Accounts

### Clean up unconfirmed "junk" users

Magic-link signup creates a `users` row on the *first* submission of any
email, before the link is ever clicked. Even with throttling on repeated
submissions (see the 2026-06 auth throttle spec in `docs/specs/`), a trickle
of unconfirmed rows is expected by design.

A "junk" user is a `users` row with:
- no `users_tokens` row with `context: "session"` (magic link never clicked), and
- no linked `identities` (no OAuth login either)

These rows are inert (default `:free` plan, no talks/resources), but they
clutter the `users` table, skew future signup/user-count metrics, and each
carries an unused `api_key`.

**Open questions for later:** grace period before a row counts as cleanup-eligible
(needs to tolerate slow email delivery / people who haven't clicked yet —
30 days suggested as a starting point), and how cleanup runs (mix task on a
schedule vs. a scheduled GenServer).

deferred rate limiting on magic link sends).

## Manual/Live-Environment Testing

Follow-on manual-test coverage identified while designing
`docs/specs/2026-06-13-dashboard-session-analytics-manual-tests-design.md`
(speaker dashboard + session analytics sections of `docs/manual_tests.md`).

### SSH/eval magic-link-token helper for production runs

`scripts/manual_tests/dashboard.sh` and `session_analytics.sh` are dev-only
because their shared `complete_magic_link_login` helper depends on
`/dev/mailbox`, which doesn't exist in production. Their own logic (talk CRUD,
session analytics) has no environment-specific branching — only the
login/email-delivery step is genuinely production-sensitive.

Production is a `mix release` build with no `mix`/source in the runner image
(confirmed via `Dockerfile`/`fly.toml`), but `flyctl ssh exec` +
`/app/bin/speechwave eval` — the same "remote console" mechanism `fly.toml`'s
`console_command` already uses — runs arbitrary Elixir against compiled
`Speechwave.*` modules with full DB access. This is how
`scripts/manual_tests/seed_sessions.exs` can already seed data in production
(see the dashboard/session-analytics spec).

The same mechanism can generate a **login token** instead of relying on email:
call `Accounts.deliver_login_instructions/2` (or build a token directly via
`UserToken.build_email_token/2`) and print the resulting
`/users/magic_link/:token` URL. A sibling of `complete_magic_link_login` would
SSH-generate this URL via `flyctl ssh exec` and have rodney navigate straight
to it on `https://speechwave.live` — no email delivery, no polling, no
third-party mailbox service. This would unblock production runs of
`dashboard.sh` and `session_analytics.sh`, and any future authenticated-flow
script.

One new cost worth tracking: unlike dev runs (throwaway local DB), a
production run leaves behind a real `manual-test-<timestamp>@example.com`
user — and because it completes login, it gets a `users_tokens` row with
`context: "session"`, so it won't qualify as a "junk user" under the cleanup
rule above. Production runs should delete this user (not just the talk) as
part of cleanup, or it becomes its own clutter source.

**Considered and rejected:** a "secret test-email-domain" allow-listed for a
login *bypass* in production (skipping token generation/verification
entirely). Rejected in favor of the SSH/eval approach above, which uses the
same token-issuance code real users go through and is gated by `flyctl`
access (already restricted to the Fly org) rather than an app-level secret
that would have to live in scripts/CI.

### Manual test: account settings (email change, API key regen)

`UserLive.Settings` (email change, API key regeneration, OAuth identity
connect/disconnect) has no manual-test coverage. The email-change and
API-key-regen pieces are natural next steps once `complete_magic_link_login`
exists (see the dashboard/session-analytics spec above), since they just need
an authenticated session plus — for email change — a second pass through the
magic-link/email flow to confirm the new address.

### Manual test: OAuth connect/disconnect

Connecting/disconnecting Google/Microsoft/GitHub identities from
`UserLive.Settings` requires real provider credentials and driving each
provider's own hosted consent UI — a genuinely different category from the
rest of `docs/manual_tests.md`, not just a sequencing question. Deferred
until there's a concrete need to test this path.

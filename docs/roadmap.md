# Roadmap

Deferred work identified while working on other projects. Items here are
acknowledged but intentionally not in scope for the work that surfaced them.
Move an item out (with a link to its spec/plan) once it's actively planned.

## Auth & Accounts

### Clean up unconfirmed "junk" users

Magic-link signup creates a `users` row on the *first* submission of any
email, before the link is ever clicked. Even with throttling on repeated
submissions (see the 2026-06 auth throttle spec in `docs/specs/`), a trickle
of unconfirmed rows is expected by design.

A "junk" user is a `users` row with:
- no `users_tokens` row with `context: "session"` (magic link never clicked), and
- no linked `identities` (no OAuth login either)

These rows are inert (default `:free` plan, no talks/resources), but they
clutter the `users` table, skew future signup/user-count metrics, and each
carries an unused `api_key`.

**Open questions for later:** grace period before a row counts as cleanup-eligible
(needs to tolerate slow email delivery / people who haven't clicked yet —
30 days suggested as a starting point), and how cleanup runs (mix task on a
schedule vs. a scheduled GenServer).

deferred rate limiting on magic link sends).
